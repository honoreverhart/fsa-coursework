Unit Tests:

1. A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.
Example:
    function multiplication(){
        input = (10 * 5)
        return input
    }

    console.log(multiplication)

    Expect input to take in only two inputs
    Expect any two input numbers to multiply correctly
    Expect input to multiply decimals correctly
    Expect input to multiply negative numbers correctly

2. A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. 
It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.

    example conactOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1])
    
    
    expect 'for loop' to read through all numbers in both arrays
    expect if statement to seperate the even and odd numbers
    expect if statment to add all odd numbers into a new array
    expect negative numbers to still be sorted into odds and evens
    expect fractions to not count as an input


Functional Test:

A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. 
They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest. 

    The shopping cart should allow logged-in users to log in before shopping
    The shopping cart should allow customer to shop as a guest
    The shopping cart should allow the costumer to make an account if they dont have one
    The shopping cart should add an unlimited amount of items to cart
    The shopping cart should add the cost of each item, including tax
    The shopping cart should add up the cost of all items, including tax, and present a total
    The shopping cart should only save whats in the cart if the customer is signed in
